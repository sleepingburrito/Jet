Jet is a software 3D rendering engine meant to be used for replicating the look of older 3D games. Its named Jet because it was meant to be faster than my past attempts. It has affine texture mapping, hard rounding on vertices to make them pop into place, and low draw distance at the polygon level. I wanted to feel PS1 like. This project was more educational on the history of 3D graphics for me than something to actually use. It only support the rendering of textured meshes with no lighting or shading effects.

WASD moves
Arrow keys rotate the camera
Q, E change the cameras elevation

All code and graphics are by me (though the test map is basically de dust 2). Code it MIT licenses.
